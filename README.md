# Devoid

# Task List

- [ ] .link styles (not nav) (don't forget error/404)
- [ ] Figure out if I can stop glow bleeds between lines for ASCII art while still having glow
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Fuck native title tooltip, come up with something else + keep aria-label
- [ ] Per-character deciphering animation on tooltip?
- [ ] What background color for tooltip? Same as base + a border color + outset + inset shadow (glow) ?
- [ ] But if I use border it's not longer character-only based UI, so figure out a character-only frame to the tooltip box?
